# Step 2
Write an implementation of a function map that applies a block to all elements of an array and returns an array of the results. For example,
``` map([1,2,3]) { |x| x * x } ``` should return ``` [1,4,9] ```

Hint: Adapt the filter function

What is the code of your function?

# Step 3
Construct a tree object
```
        84
      /    \
     7     12
          / | \
         2  2  3
```
in a variable t.
How do you do that?
How do you compute the sum of all values in the tree (using the visit method, of course)
